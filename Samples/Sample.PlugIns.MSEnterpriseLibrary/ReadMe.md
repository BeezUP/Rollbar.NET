# Sample: Rollbar.NET via MS Enterprise Library's Exception Handling Block

This example demonstrates how to integrate Rollbar.NET within an application that already uses MS Enterprise Library's Exception Handling Block for its exception logging purposes

Have fun taking advantages for Rollbar Dashboard while monitoring behavior of your products!

Here is an example of an error log from this sample rendered within the Rollbar Dashboard:
